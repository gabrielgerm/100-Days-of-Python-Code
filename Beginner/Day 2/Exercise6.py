BMI Wikipedia Page

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)'''

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65

float_height = float(height)
int_weight = int(weight)
result = (int_weight/(float_height**2))
