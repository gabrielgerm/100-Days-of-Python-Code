#Instructions

'''You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.'''


# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
  
# Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡
sum_heights = 0
students = 0
for heights in student_heights:
  sum_heights += heights
  students += 1
average = sum_heights/students
print(f"total height = {sum_heights}\nnumber of students = {students}\naverage height = {round(average)}")
