#Instructions

'''You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 1 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

NOTE: Don't worry about getting hold of the input(), we've done the work behind the scenes to import everything.

HINT: Assume that names looks like this: input: x, y, z, names = ["x", "y", "z"]'''


names = names_string.split(", ")
# The code above converts the input into an array seperating
#each name in the input by a comma and space.
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
import random
choosen_person = random.randint(0, len(names)-1)

print(f"{names[choosen_person]} is going to buy the meal today!")
